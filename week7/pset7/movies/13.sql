--In 13.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred.

--Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
--There may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the Kevin Bacon born in 1958.
--Kevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.
